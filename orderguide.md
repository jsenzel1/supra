This is an ordering guide for SUPRA 
right now for internal use - but might be useful for people to see how it works 

## STEP 1

order boards from JLC 
JLC boards and panels for production runs are always reorders to prevent alterations resulting in bricked runs 
more info and links for this coming, for now I'll probably be basically doing it 


## STEP 2 
order this cart from [mouser](https://www.mouser.com/Tools/Project/Share?AccessId=abbf7e4cee) 
you will have to select the items - this is for 100 modules, so the numbers can be changed accordingly 

PUBLIC NOTE: (this temp guide is for existing manufacturer ordering parts - so it doesn't include parts that are already stocked at their warehouse 
see [BOM](https://airtable.com/appK64nfCek7UE6Ky/shrHy2ZPqv2uyKhwK) for all parts 

## STEP 3

order this [display](https://www.buydisplay.com/i2c-white-1-3-inch-oled-display-module-128x64-arduino-raspberry-pi) from buydisplay 
note: fast shipping is extra but required for quick turnaround

## STEP 4 

order these [joystick toppers](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Silica-gel-Pushbutton-Tactile-Protector/dp/B07PGTZP9Z/ref=sr_1_2?dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.WwI1lxE8HuPTMmMGShuaAnsLmxqUn5CKKHlRQyjN8wTGkMHiqbyhxqTm5cMSaoG90YCanVC2cSptbkSt66XLqEFAWsOIjlujdrPuwgNaV_sjS1BJiWk9KV1R_JZUyrWWKkvpVfe5z2HymQhs_dOEztCkAYI9kiyi0Obt2qo2MTWo3n70Bb2pcDgIWarhF4hWZL5c8FY4SETua0SA87m-f9rp8Us9mE0dv-o1j2-k4Tc.9tMkTW01nV1p-FH2aX2YJCVfb61wtaqxBJHbLlGSoM0&dib_tag=se&keywords=uxcell+20pcs+Tactile+Push+Button+Switch+Caps+3mm+Hole+Dia+for+6x6mm+Micro+Tactile+Switch+Black&nsdOptOutParam=true&qid=1763407890&sr=8-2) from amazon (RIP, literally cannot find them anywhere else and I have order lik $60 of various button toppers, these are the only that have worked at all) 

That should be it for now!
